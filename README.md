## The Problem Wild Eyes Solves

Many of us are unable to appreciate the biodiversity in our surroundings due to a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Even with the curiosity to inquire, our efforts are limited by language barriers in areas where we encounter exotic species, and we are often unsure about the authenticity of available resources. This creates a disconnect from the natural world's rich biodiversity.

Wild Eyes bridges this gap by providing a seamless, accurate, and informative identification tool that quenches a user's thirst for knowledge.

### üß† Core Models: Species Recognition

The heart of Wild Eyes lies in its highly accurate species detection models. We built two distinct classifiers‚Äîone for animals and one for plants‚Äîusing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

*   **Model Architecture**: Both models are **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, ideal for image recognition.
*   **Transfer Learning**: We employed **transfer learning** using the pre-trained **VGG16** model as our base. VGG16's training on the extensive ImageNet dataset gives it a powerful ability to recognize features like edges, textures, and shapes.
*   **Fine-Tuning**: We then **fine-tuned** this base model by adding custom **Dense, Flatten, and Dropout layers**. These layers were trained on our specific animal and plant datasets, adapting the model for our specific task.
*   **Data Augmentation**: To make the models more robust and prevent overfitting, we used Keras's **ImageDataGenerator** to artificially expand the training dataset by shearing, zooming, and flipping images.
